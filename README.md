WebGL-based Quake MDL Viewer
============================

This repository contains a WebGL-based viewer for Quake MDL files with full support for textures and animations.

Animations are hardcoded in QuakeC so currently we simply dump all frames into a single continuous animation. In the future we could detect standard models such as `player.mdl` and hardcode support for these animations.

Due to copyright restrictions you have to supply your own `.mdl` files.
